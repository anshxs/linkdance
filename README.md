# LinkDance  

LinkDance is an open-source **Linktree alternative** that allows users to create and share personalized link pages **without signing up or authentication**. All data is stored **locally** and encoded into a **Base64 URL**, which is then shortened using the **TinyURL API** for easy sharing.
